            <p>Sariah is apart of a weekly Dance and Gymnastics class. 
            According to the website 
<a href="https://www.sportsrec.com/5082390/what-are-the-benefits-of-gymnastics-for-kids" target="_blank">sportsrec.com</a> dance 
            and gymnastics will have many benefits to improving young 
            childrenâ€™s lives. Among those include the obvious health 
            benefits that come just as natural as playing to her. 
            Every lesson begins with stretching and warming up and 
            teaches good habits. Being in a small group of girls 
            will also help develop her socialization skills and 
            have emotional benefits as well.</p>

            <p>It can be hard to see some of those benefits from day 
            to day but one thing that is apparent is her growth in 
            the time that she's started her dance and gymnastics 
            classes, she's shown great commitment and discipline. 
            Another thing she's improved since she's begun classes 
            is her listening and following skills. She's gracefully 
            completed different dances and earns new stickers to 
            place on a chart we stuck on our fridge for each week.</p>
