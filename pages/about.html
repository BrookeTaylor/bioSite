        <p>Meet Sariah, she’s a typical 6-year-old sweetheart. To 
        much of her parent’s dismay when asked what her favorite 
        thing was she’ll tell you, “My Nintendo.”</p> 
        
        <p>However, when she doesn’t have her head down in a screen, 
        she partakes a wide variety of activities.</p> 
        
        <p>She has a passion for all her animals. In her daily 
        circle she adores on three different dogs Bear, Luna, 
        and Ollie. There’s an outdoor cat named Bandit that 
        she’s best friends with too. There’s even an aquarium 
        in her grandpa’s computer room with 10 different 
        fish and a bird too! Riah, our nickname for her, 
        spends time with each of her little animals every day.</p>
            
        <p>On top of her busy schedule taking care of 
        her own animals, occasionally on her weekend 
        outings she’ll traverse the greater metropolitan 
        area visiting different petting zoos to help feed 
        and love on all the local animals. Among all of 
        them her favorites are the ponies, pigmy goats, 
        and stingrays! Her favorite zoo is in St. Louis, 
        Missouri and she most looks forward to seeing all 
        the different bears.</p>

        <p>Sariah is also a bit of a thrill seeker. Every 
        trip to the amusement park she’s intrigued about 
        her height so that she can see if she’s able to 
        ride any new and scarier rides. She says that her 
        favorite ride is the “chicken boat ride!” Which you 
        ride a short canoe that can seat as much as four, 
        it’ll send you on a Viking themed ride down a windy 
        river with hills and drops.</p>

        <p>Outside of that, her hobbies include dance, 
        gymnastics, and ice skating. She very recently 
        started school and told me that her favorite class 
        so far was music.</p>

        <p>Last and certainly not least of all from our young 
        girl’s little perspective, but games, her favorite 
        game is easily The Legend of Zelda Breath of the 
        Wild. On occasion she’ll request that I beat up 
        Ganon; but she spends most of her time chasing and 
        taming all the wild horses after rescuing them from 
        evil goblins. She gets quite the kick out of beating 
        me at Super Smash Bros with her favorite character, 
        Zelda, of course. She is quite competitive when it 
        comes to games!</p>
