        <p>Meet Sariah, she’s a typical 6-year-old sweetheart. To 
            much of her parent’s dismay when asked what her favorite 
            thing was she’ll tell you, “My Nintendo.” However, when 
            she doesn’t have her head down in a screen, she partakes 
            a wide variety of activities. 
            She has a passion for all her animals. In her daily 
            circle she adores on three different dogs Bear, Luna, 
            and Ollie. There’s an outdoor cat named Bandit that 
            she’s best friends with too. There’s even an aquarium 
            in her grandpa’s computer room with 10 different 
            fish and a bird too! Riah, our nickname for her, 
            spends time with each of her little animals every 
            day. On top of her busy schedule taking care of 
            her own animals, occasionally on her weekend 
            outings she’ll traverse the greater metropolitan 
            area visiting different petting zoos to help feed 
            and love on all the local animals. Among all of 
            them her favorites are the ponies, pigmy goats, 
            and stingrays! Her favorite zoo is in St. Louis, 
            Missouri and she most looks forward to seeing all 
            the different bears. 
            Sariah is also a bit of a thrill seeker. Every 
            trip to the amusement park she’s intrigued about 
            her height so that she can see if she’s able to 
            ride any new and scarier rides. She says that her 
            favorite ride is the “chicken boat ride!” Which you 
            ride a short canoe that can seat as much as four, 
            it’ll send you on a Viking themed ride down a windy 
            river with hills and drops. 
            Outside of that, her hobbies include dance, 
            gymnastics, and ice skating. She very recently 
            started school and told me that her favorite class 
            so far was music. 
            Last and certainly not least of all from our young 
            girl’s little perspective, but games, her favorite 
            game is easily The Legend of Zelda Breath of the 
            Wild. On occasion she’ll request that I beat up 
            Ganon; but she spends most of her time chasing and 
            taming all the wild horses after rescuing them from 
            evil goblins. She gets quite the kick out of beating 
            me at Super Smash Bros with her favorite character, 
            Zelda, of course. She is quite competitive when it 
            comes to games!</p>
